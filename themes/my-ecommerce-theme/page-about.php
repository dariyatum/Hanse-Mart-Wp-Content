            <span>Hansemart is a family run business and started off as an online shopping service (one of the first in the UK) in 2006, delivering Hanse goods to the whole of the UK. As the website grew bigger, there was a demand to open a shop which allows us to provide produce and a local delivery service to the local area.</span>
